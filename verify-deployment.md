# App Runner Deployment Verification

## Current Status ✅
- Health routes work locally: `http://localhost:3001/api/health/database`
- Routes are properly registered in your code
- No import or code errors

## Issue ❌
Your deployed App Runner service is running old code without the new health endpoints.

## Solution: Trigger App Runner Redeploy

### Step 1: Check Current Deployment Status
```bash
# Test basic health endpoint (should work)
curl https://pkj8y2aqkp.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/health

# Test new endpoints (currently fails with "route not found")
curl https://pkj8y2aqkp.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/api/health/database
```

### Step 2: Trigger Redeploy

**Option A: Git Push (if auto-deploy is configured)**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add DynamoDB health check endpoints and debugging tools"
git push origin main
```

**Option B: Manual Deploy via AWS Console**
1. Go to AWS App Runner Console
2. Select your service: `football-pick-em` 
3. Click **"Deploy"** button
4. Wait for deployment to complete

**Option C: AWS CLI**
```bash
aws apprunner start-deployment --service-arn your-service-arn
```

### Step 3: Verify After Redeploy
```bash
# These should work after redeploy:
curl https://pkj8y2aqkp.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/api/health/database
curl https://pkj8y2aqkp.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/api/health/dynamodb
```

### Step 4: Check DynamoDB Connectivity
Once redeployed, the endpoints will show whether your app is using DynamoDB:

```bash
# Check database provider
curl -s https://pkj8y2aqkp.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/api/health/database | jq '.database.type'

# If it shows "dynamodb", then it's working!
# If it shows "sqlite", check your environment variables
```

## Environment Variables to Verify in App Runner
- `NODE_ENV=production` 
- `DATABASE_TYPE=auto`
- `AWS_REGION=us-east-1`
- `DYNAMODB_TABLE_PREFIX=football_pickem_`

The health endpoints will tell you exactly what's happening with your DynamoDB connection once deployed!
